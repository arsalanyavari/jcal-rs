This project is a complete Rust re-implementation of the original “jcal”
and “jdate” concept (first written in C by Ashkan Ghasemi).  
No source code from the original utilities has been reused; only the
publicly documented calendar algorithms were re-implemented from scratch.

This Rust implementation of `jcal` / `jdate` was inspired by the original C
utilities created by Ashkan Ghasemi.  No source code was reused; only the
public-domain calendar algorithms were re-implemented.
